Because of my great passion in data science and my rich experience in data analysis. I decided to participate in the 2019 Mathematical Contest in Modeling.
For the 2019 MCM, as a team leader, I chose the topic on the distribution of drug in United States, knowing that this was already an urgent issue. Due to great similarities between drug and disease, we decided to use the classic mathematical model of epidemic diseases (SEIR) as the foundation. In order to understand, explain, predict, and prevent the spreading process of drug, we read and studied more than 50 machine learning papers on drug spreading within two days. In our final paper, we used both the SEIR model (to predict the future distribution), and knowledge in linear algebra, like matrix diagonalizing and LASSO recursion（to find the most related factors）, which enabled us to run our prediction model with both high accuracy and explainability. Based on a reasonable and efficient model, our final program could both analyze current and future distribution quite correctly, which could also potentially give us innovative ways to cut off the drug spreading paths and reduce drug abuse. Our work and contribution brought us the award: Meritorious Winner(7.09%) which was a confirmation and praise on our work to our community and society.
